# pdal-kafka-project
Kafka based project for a Product Design and Implementation course to learn how to scale Kafka while keeping data in order.

I am going to be working in three phases. Phase 1 is creating the data and getting it into Kafka. Phase 2 is consuming the data and testing that my implementation works. Phase 3, if I have time, I'm trying to create a web interface where I can view the data in real time using Websockets. 

After the course is over, I should continue implementing more observability and monitoring with Prometheus, Opentelemetry and Grafana, just for learning.
